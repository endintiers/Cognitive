# Cognitive
Client code for Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs.
Wild Mouse uses the Cognitive APIs (heavily) in their Unearth product.
There is a nice client library for Entity Linking provided by the Project Oxford team, but none for Text Analytics.
Since we had to build a client wrapper for this, may as well share it here.
Any other similar libraries we build will be uploaded here. The code "works in our project" - no effort has been made beyond that,
so please contribute and make it better if you feel for that.
Thanks, Chris
